## Overview

The **Changes Protocol** is a structured yet flexible framework designed to guide individuals through self-governance and decision-making. By integrating AI-augmented tools with human-centered principles, the protocol offers a unique way to reflect on governance issues, identify potential improvements, and refine actions for better outcomes.

This prototype is built with a 3-step process that involves selecting governance areas, preparing actionable strategies, and delivering governance outcomes, all while receiving AI-assisted insights tailored to your input.

## The Changes Protocol

The **Changes Protocol** is rooted in three essential phases that guide individuals through a reflective and iterative governance process. These phases are designed to foster continuous reflection, ensuring that governance strategies are both resilient and adaptive.

1. **Choices (Appetizer)**: 
   - This phase encourages individuals to evaluate key governance input states such as **Character**, **Intelligence**, **Services**, **Community**, or **Systems**.
   - individuals assess how aligned these input states are with specific principles like **Freedom**, **Inclusion**, and **Diversity** using the **Balance Scale** and **Flavours Compass** tools.

2. **Preparation (Main Course)**: 
   - individuals translate insights from the **Choices** phase into actionable governance practices, focusing on areas that require attention or improvement.
   - This step involves formulating strategies and plans to ensure better alignment with the selected principles.

3. **Delivery (Dessert)**: 
   - This final phase helps individuals refine governance outcomes, ensuring that they are well-aligned with the selected input states and principles.
   - The tool generates an AI-ready prompt that provides governance advice based on the user’s input and strategy.

The **Changes Protocol** is designed to be iterative, meaning individuals can revisit each phase as needed, refining their governance practices over time.
